Various scripts and data files during my Sierra bottling effort.

`install-event-table.html` and `install-event-table.txt` are based on September
2016 data. The HTML version is directly copied over from Google Analytics web
interface.

This directory is kind of a mess, but I don't plan to further document
things. Maybe these will be of use again next year, by which time I might
add more polish.
